        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>

            I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for exploring and learning new technologies. Constantly seeking to
            expand my skill set, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest innovations and trends in the tech world.
            Whether itâ€™s diving into a new programming language, experimenting with new tools, or solving complex
            problems, I am always eager to grow and enhance my expertise.

            I have strong proficiency in front-end and back-end technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript,
            Angular, React, and Next.js. I also have hands-on experience with Node.js, PHP,
            MySQL, and working with WordPress and Elementor to create dynamic and responsive websites. I am
            passionate about building full-stack applications and working with databases to deliver seamless user
            experiences.

            In addition to my technical expertise, I believe in the power of community. I enjoy staying connected with
            like-minded individuals, participating in tech communities, and building valuable networks. Collaborating
            with others not only helps me grow but also fuels my passion for continuous learning and improvement.

            I also prioritize developing my soft skills, such as effective communication, problem-solving,
            teamwork, and adaptability, which are essential for thriving in dynamic work environments.
